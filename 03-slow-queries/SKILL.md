name: 03-slow-queries
description: Reproduce and resolve RDS PostgreSQL slow-query scenarios — missing-index sequential scans, function-wrapped predicates that defeat an index, deep OFFSET pagination, JSONB field-extraction CPU spikes, stale planner statistics, application retry storms, and N+1 query patterns. Use when asked to simulate, drill, reproduce, or investigate slow/high-CPU queries, bad execution plans, or pg_stat_statements analysis.

# Slow Queries Drills

Reproducible, agent-runnable simulations for the "Slow Queries / Performance
Optimization" runbook topic, derived from `gpt-docs/ChatGPT-RDS PostgreSQL
Performance Optimization.md` and `gpt-docs/ChatGPT-RDS Postgres Issue Guide.md`.

⚠️ **NON-PRODUCTION USE ONLY.** These scripts create real load and real schema
changes (indexes) against whatever `PGDATABASE` you point them at. Always run
against a disposable/drill database.

## Setup

1. Copy `simulations/.env.example` to `.env` in the directory you'll run
   scripts from (repo root works) and fill in `PGHOST`/`PGPORT`/`PGUSER`/
   `PGPASSWORD`/`PGDATABASE`.
2. Run the shared setup once: `psql -h $PGHOST -p $PGPORT -U $PGUSER -d $PGDATABASE -f 01_setup_slow_query_tables.sql`
   (or `set -a; source .env; set +a` first if you don't want to pass `-h`/`-U` by hand).
3. Run any drill script directly, e.g. `./02_simulate_missing_index_scan.sh`.

## Detectability by the live slow-queries hunter

Scripts `02`-`05` do two extra things after the demonstration
`EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` (which alone finishes in well under a second and
is invisible to a poll-based hunter):

1. Holds one session `state='active'` for a few seconds (`hold_session_active`
   in `_lib/env.sh`) — at these fast-drill settings this is well under the
   `query_slow` >=30s threshold in `AI-Hunters/actions/slow-queries.jsonc`;
   see the CAVEAT below.
2. Bursts a few hundred to a couple thousand repeated scans in a single
   PL/pgSQL `DO` block (`run_seq_scan_burst`) — aims at the `seq_scan_tables`
   >1000-scan / >80%-ratio threshold in
   `AI-Hunters/queries/slow-queries/slow-queries-seq-scans.sql`, though at
   the lower burst counts used by `04`/`05` it may land under 1000.

CAVEAT: every drill script in this folder (01-07) is now sized to finish in
<=20s by default — hold durations, burst counts, and seeded row counts were
all cut down from far larger values that were originally tuned to clear the
live hunter's 300s poll interval and its `query_critical` >=1800s / `query_slow`
>=30s thresholds with wide margin. That hunter-detection reliability is
knowingly deprioritized here in favor of a fast local drill run — pass larger
explicit arguments (e.g. `./07_simulate_retry_storm.sh 1500 300`) or edit a
script's defaults directly if you need a real hunter-detection window.

`06` (stale statistics) additionally disables
per-table autovacuum and resets `slowq_orders`' stat counters before the bulk
insert, so `last_analyze`/`last_autoanalyze` reliably read NULL instead of
racing autovacuum's autoanalyze, and leaves autovacuum disabled afterward —
do not run `06` back-to-back with `02`'s seq-scan burst, since the stat reset
also zeroes `seq_scan`/`idx_scan`.

Every issue (missing index, function-defeated index, stale statistics) is
left in place — none of these scripts fix or clean anything up — so the
hunter has an indefinite window to detect it, well beyond its own drill run.

## Non-interactive / agent mode

Every script that mutates schema or data (creates an index, bulk-inserts, or
opens many connections) calls a shared `confirm_drill` helper that now only
prints a banner — it fires immediately, no typed-`yes` gate. `--yes`/
`DRILL_YES=1` are still accepted (harmlessly) for backward compatibility.
Pure read-only `EXPLAIN`-only scripts (04) skip the helper entirely.

## Automated full run

`run_all.sh` runs setup once, then launches all 6 drills CONCURRENTLY (not
one at a time) to stack simultaneous load on the shared `slowq_*` tables,
then runs the diagnostic sweep once every drill has finished — one command
for the whole topic. No fix/remediation or cleanup step. `--list` previews
the manifest; `--fast` (default, aggressive) / `--full` (even more
aggressive) control offset depth / retry-storm size.

```bash
./run_all.sh --list                # preview
DRILL_YES=1 ./run_all.sh           # fast, full manifest
```

## Script catalog

| Script | Reproduces |
|---|---|
| `01_setup_slow_query_tables.sql` | — (setup) Creates `slowq_orders` (300k rows), `slowq_customers` (50k), `slowq_json_events` (300k), no non-PK indexes |
| `02_simulate_missing_index_scan.sh` | Seq scan from an unindexed filter column |
| `03_simulate_function_wrapped_predicate.sh` | `lower(email) = ...` defeating a plain index |
| `04_simulate_offset_pagination.sh` | Deep `OFFSET` pagination vs. keyset pagination — read-only, no confirm needed |
| `05_simulate_json_processing_spike.sh` | CPU spike from unindexed `jsonb ->> field` filtering |
| `06_simulate_stale_statistics.sh` | Bad plan from stale `pg_stat_user_tables` statistics after bulk insert (autovacuum left disabled) |
| `07_simulate_retry_storm.sh` | Application retry storm multiplying load on an already-slow query — `[session_count] [retries_per_session]` |
| `08_diagnostic_query_sweep.sql` | — (detection) Full first-response sweep: active queries, wait events, `pg_stat_statements` top/N+1 candidates, missing-index candidates, stale-stats candidates, session fan-out, index bloat |

## Quick start

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a

psql -h $PGHOST -p $PGPORT -U $PGUSER -d $PGDATABASE -f 01_setup_slow_query_tables.sql
./02_simulate_missing_index_scan.sh --yes
psql -h $PGHOST -p $PGPORT -U $PGUSER -d $PGDATABASE -f 08_diagnostic_query_sweep.sql
```
